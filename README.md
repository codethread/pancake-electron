# Pomo 🍅

Simple Pomodoro timer, with integrations such as Slack, to politely mute your notifications and let
your colleagues know when you'll be back

## Usage

**🚧 Currently in Beta**

_MacOS only right now_

To use the app, head to the [Releases](https://github.com/AHDesigns/pomo-electron/releases) and grab
the `.dmg` or `arm64.dmg` file, depending on whether you've got an intel or arm chip (`assets` is a
dropdown, see screenshot below, the `version` number may change, but you get the idea).

There are many small features to add and these are tracked on the
[Roadmap](https://github.com/AHDesigns/pomo-electron/projects/1)

Please
[raise any bugs or request any features here](https://github.com/AHDesigns/pomo-electron/issues/new/choose).

### Slack Integration

If you want to use the slack settings, you can go to the settings in the Pomo app, (the button at
the top left takes you there), and then you’ll see a form to add the relevant credentials:

- a slack token: go to https://my.slack.com/customize, open your browser devTools and copy what you
  get from typing `TS.boot_data.api_token`
- a 'd' cookie: to get the cookies, you can go to slack in the browser (like any normal chat window,
  not the customise page) and grab the `d` and `d-s` cookies
- a 'd-s' cookie: as above.

## Contributing

_Pomo is not yet ready for contribution, but once V1 is released, all contributions will be welcome,
and the approach to making changes will be very clear_

Pomo is an [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app built using:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) throughout (with very strict settings)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the GUI
- [Xstate](https://xstate.js.org/docs/) for state management
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for electron e2e testing, and visual regression tests
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction) for building components
  and User documentation
- Github actions for CI (not yet supporting publishing)

Install a node manager of your choice (volta is supported and recommended)

Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

Run the electron app and client locally

```bash
yarn dev
```

Run storybook for developing UI components

```bash
yarn storybook
```
