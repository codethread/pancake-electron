# Pancake üçÖ

Github at a glance

## Usage

**üöß Currently in Beta**

_MacOS only right now_

To use the app, head to the [Releases](https://github.com/AHDesigns/pomo-electron/releases) and grab
the `.dmg` or `arm64.dmg` file, depending on whether you've got an intel or arm chip (`assets` is a
dropdown, see screenshot below, the `version` number may change, but you get the idea).

There are many small features to add and these are tracked on the [Roadmap](https://github.com/codethread/pancake-electron/projects/4)

Please [raise any bugs or request any features here](https://github.com/codethread/pancake-electron/issues/new/choose).

## Contributing

_Pancake is not yet ready for contribution, but once V1 is released, all contributions will be welcome,
and the approach to making changes will be very clear_

Pancake is an [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app built using:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) throughout (with very strict settings)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the GUI
- [Xstate](https://xstate.js.org/docs/) for state management
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for electron e2e testing, and visual regression tests
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction) for building components
  and User documentation
- Github actions for CI (not yet supporting publishing)

Install a node manager of your choice (volta is supported and recommended)

Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

Run the electron app and client locally

```bash
yarn dev
```

Run storybook for developing UI components

```bash
yarn storybook
```
